# Contributing Guidelines

We're glad that you want to contribute to Pythonista! You can contribute in many ways, but before you do, ensure that the work you submit is your own or that you have legal authority to submit it as your own.

## Contributing Code

Pythonista is a repository of Python scripts that range from the silly, fun ones to the complicated ones that actually make life a lot easier. In order to contribute a script, you must create a directory within the `scripts` directory with the name of your script, and update the `scripts/README.md` file in accordance with the instructions given there.

Detailed guidelines for contributing code can be found in `scripts/README.md`.

**Contributions that do not pass all status checks will not be accepted unless there's a very good reason to accept them**

## Contributing Documentation

Being a collection of code from a bunch of people, it is very important that everything about Pythonista is well documented. Currently, the `README.md` file needs completion. You can check out the `TODO.md` file to see if there are any missing pieces of documentation that need work.

## Contributing In Other Ways

Your contributions don't have to be limited to code or documentation. You can be a part of the Pythonista community and help us grow in many other ways including:
- Opening issues with helpful suggestions or bug reports
- Helping us close issues by contributing appropriately
- Letting us know about deprecated code or out-of-date dependencies

All of these ways involve using the GitHub Issue Tracker to communicate with us, so please take care to avoid saying things that may be offensive or unrelated, and make sure that every discussion is carried out in good spirit.
