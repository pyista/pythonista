## Guidelines
-  Each script should be in it's own seperate directory.
- The script name must be same as the directory name of the script.
-  All scripts should be invokable as `python main.py`. That is, the file that is to be called by the python interpreter should be named `main.py`.
- If your script has dependencies, it should contain a `requirements.txt`.
- Each script directory should contain a `README.md` file with installation and usage instructions, description, and any other information needed.
- You should also edit this README and add your script to it in accordance with the [template](#template).
- If the script you are contributing is under version control, make sure you add it as a [git submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules).
