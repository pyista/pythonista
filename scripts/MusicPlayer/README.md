This is a basic music player project which is used to play music.

Once we run it, we get a GUI with 2 buttons. 'Select Songs' and 'o'. We select a song through the 'Select Songs' button and 'o' button is used to start or stop the song.

Audio files should be present in same folder as .py file is present.
